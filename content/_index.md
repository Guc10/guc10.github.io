## hello there_

I am a young student from poland who constantly wants to improve myself and my skills,
my biggest dream is to create machines that fly, taking people to the skies.
I love laying on the grass in the night, stargazing, and searching for my favourite
stars and galaxies. I have my own telescope which helps
me with learning about those things that are beyond the eye's reach.

At the moment, I am focused on developing my programming skills—I absolutely love writing in C#.
I work on Linux, which is a great environment for me because I enjoy using the console.

In addition to programming, I work with 3D graphics, mostly using Blender.
I also have some experience with game engines like UE5 and Unity. With some friends of mine,
we've created a small open-world game as part of a semester project. Those models that I've designed
are also used for 3D printing my own parts, first using FDM printers and now focusing on SLA technology.
